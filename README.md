# Project Title :
Azure Photo-Storage Website

# Problem Statement :
The problem statement for the Photo Storage project revolves around the need for a user-centric and scalable photo management platform. Existing photo storage solutions may lack a seamless user interface, efficient cloud-based storage, and integration of advanced features such as real-time language translation. The project aims to address these shortcomings by developing a web application that combines user-friendly design with robust cloud storage capabilities, leveraging technologies like Firebase and Azure services. The goal is to provide a secure, responsive, and globally accessible platform for users to manage and interact with t1. heir photos efficiently.

# Project Description :
The Photo Storage project is a web application designed for efficient and user-friendly photo management. Leveraging technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase, and Microsoft Azure services, the project enables users to seamlessly upload, view, and delete photos. The platform incorporates a responsive design for diverse devices, integrates cloud-based storage for accessibility, and employs Azure services for scalability and performance optimization. Notable features include real-time language translation using Azure AI services, enhancing the global accessibility of the platform.

# Industry Type :
Lifestyle

# Core Azure Services :
- Azure App Service (For hosting the website)
- Virtual Machines, LoadBalancer (for manging the traffic of network)
- Monitoring Alert (Tracking of problems to report)


# Azure AI Services :
- Azure AI Translator


# Web Technologies Used :
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

# IDE Used :
- Visual Studio Code
- Firebase
  
# Steps Followed While Deploying :
1) Built the whole Web Application on the Visual Studio Code and the Database on Firebase.
2) Created a Backup of the Database as backup folder and connect with the firebase photo storage
3) Created a 2 Virtual Machines of Windows (OS) 
4) Connected both the Virtual Machine with RDP File 
5) Add a Roles and Features of IIS in Virtual Machine and installed it.
6) Further I Created a Loadbalancer for balancing the network traffic of a Web Page
7) Then, Created a Monitoring (Alert) to Monitor a Virtual Machine
8) And after this , went to create a Azure AI-Translator to translate the text of a web page from one language to another language
9) Uploaded the code in Virtual Machines as well as in Github Repository
10) And finally created a App Services - In this created a Static Web Page to host a website
